= Securing connectivity to the Kafka cluster

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the following between the HTTP Bridge and your Kafka cluster:

* TLS or SASL-based authentication
* A TLS-encrypted connection

You configure the HTTP Bridge for authentication through its xref:proc-configuring-http-bridge-{context}[properties file].

You can also use ACLs in Kafka brokers to restrict the topics that can be consumed and produced using the HTTP Bridge.

NOTE: Use the `KafkaBridge` resource to configure authentication when you are xref:overview-components-running-http-bridge-cluster-{context}[running the HTTP Bridge on Kubernetes].
