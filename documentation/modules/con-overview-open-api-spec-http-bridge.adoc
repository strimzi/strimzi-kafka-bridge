= HTTP Bridge OpenAPI specification

[role="_abstract"]
HTTP Bridge APIs use the OpenAPI Specification (OAS).
OAS provides a standard framework for describing and implementing HTTP APIs.

The HTTP Bridge OpenAPI specification is in JSON format.
You can find the OpenAPI JSON files in the `src/main/resources/` folder of the HTTP Bridge source download files.
The download files are available from the {ReleaseDownload}.

You can also use the xref:openapi[`GET /openapi` method] to retrieve the OpenAPI v3 specification in JSON format.
