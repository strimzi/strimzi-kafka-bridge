[role="_abstract"]
Install the Strimzi Kafka Bridge to run in the same environment as your Kafka cluster.

You can download and add the Kafka Bridge installation artifacts to your host machine.

== Running the Kafka Bridge on Kubernetes

If you deployed Strimzi on Kubernetes, you can use the Strimzi Cluster Operator to deploy the Kafka Bridge to the Kubernetes cluster.
Configure and deploy the Kafka Bridge as a `KafkaBridge` resource.
You'll need a running Kafka cluster that was deployed by the Cluster Operator in a Kubernetes namespace.
You can configure your deployment to access the Kafka Bridge outside the Kubernetes cluster.

For information on deploying and configuring the Kafka Bridge as a `KafkaBridge` resource, see the {BookURLConfiguring}.
