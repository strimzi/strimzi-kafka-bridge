= Running the Kafka Bridge

[role="_abstract"]
Install the Strimzi Kafka Bridge to run in the same environment as your Kafka cluster.

You can download and add the Kafka Bridge installation artifacts to your host machine.
To try out the Kafka Bridge in your local environment, see the xref:assembly-kafka-bridge-quickstart-{context}[Kafka Bridge quickstart].

If you deployed Strimzi on Kubernetes, you can use the Strimzi Cluster Operator to deploy the Kafka Bridge to the Kubernetes cluster.
You'll need a running Kafka cluster that was deployed by the Cluster Operator in a Kubernetes namespace.
You can configure your deployment to access the Kafka Bridge outside the Kubernetes cluster.
