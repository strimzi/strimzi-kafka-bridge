= Configuring distributed tracing

[role="_abstract"]
Enable distributed tracing to trace messages consumed and produced by the Kafka Bridge, and HTTP requests from client applications.

Properties to enable tracing are present in the `application.properties` file.
To enable distributed tracing, do the following:

* Set the `bridge.tracing` property value to enable the tracing you want to use. Possible values are `jaeger` and `opentelemetry`.
* Set environment variables for tracing.

With the default configuration, you can implement a Jaeger tracing system based on OpenTelemetry or OpenTracing.

OpenTelemetry and OpenTracing are API specifications for collecting tracing data as _spans_ of metrics data.
Spans represent a specific operation.
A trace is a collection of one or more spans.

Traces are generated when the Kafka Bridge does the following:

* Sends messages from Kafka to consumer HTTP clients 
* Receives messages from producer HTTP clients to send to Kafka

Jaeger implements the required APIs and presents visualizations of the trace data in its user interface for analysis. 

To have end-to-end tracing, you must configure tracing in your HTTP clients.

CAUTION: The OpenTracing project is now archived, so Strimzi has deprecated support for OpenTracing.

.Prerequisites

* xref:proc-downloading-kafka-bridge-{context}[The Kafka Bridge installation archive is downloaded].

.Procedure

. Edit the `application.properties` file provided with the Kafka Bridge installation archive.
+
Use the `bridge.tracing` property to enable the tracing you want to use. 
+
.Example configuration to enable OpeTelemetry
[source,properties]
----
#bridge.tracing=jaeger # <1>
bridge.tracing=opentelemetry # <2>
----
<1> The property for enabling OpenTracing (deprecated). Here left commented.
<2> The property for enabling OpenTelemetry is uncommented. 
+
With tracing enabled, you initialize tracing when you run the Kafka Bridge script.

. Save the configuration file.
. Set the environment variables for tracing.
+
.Environment variables for OpenTelemetry 
[source,env]
----
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-tracing-service # <1>
----
<1> The name of the OpenTelemetry tracer service.
+
.Environment variables for OpenTracing
[source,env]
----
JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME=my-jaeger-service # <1>
JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=localhost # <2>
JAEGER_AGENT_PORT=6831 # <3>
----
<1> The name of the OpenTracing Jaeger tracer service.
<2> The hostname for communicating with the Jaeger agent that listens for spans.
<3> The port for communicating with the Jaeger agent. Port 6831 is exposed by the Jaeger agent. 

. Run the Kafka Bridge script with the property enabled for tracing:
+
.Running the Kafka Bridge with OpenTelementry enabled 
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
./bin/kafka_bridge_run.sh --config-file=_<path>_/application.properties
----
+
The internal consumers and producers of the Kafka Bridge are now enabled for tracing.

== Specifying tracing systems with OpenTelemetry

Instead of the default Jaeger system, you can specify other tracing systems that are supported by OpenTelemetry.

If you want to use another tracing system with OpenTelemetry, do the following: 

. Add the library of the tracing system to the Kafka classpath.
. Add the name of the tracing system as an additional exporter environment variable.
+
.Additional environment variable when not using Jaeger 
[source,env]
----
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-tracing-service
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=zipkin # <1>
----
<1> The name of the tracing system. In this example, Zipkin is specified.
