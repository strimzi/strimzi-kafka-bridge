= Securing the HTTP Bridge HTTP interface

[role="_abstract"]
Authentication and encryption between HTTP clients and the HTTP Bridge is not supported directly by the HTTP Bridge.
Requests sent from clients to the HTTP Bridge are sent without authentication or encryption.
Requests must use HTTP rather than HTTPS.

You can combine the HTTP Bridge with the following tools to secure it:

* Network policies and firewalls that define which pods can access the HTTP Bridge
* Reverse proxies (for example, OAuth 2.0)
* API gateways
