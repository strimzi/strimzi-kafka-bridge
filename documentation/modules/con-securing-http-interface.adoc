= Securing the Kafka Bridge HTTP interface

[role="_abstract"]
Authentication and encryption between HTTP clients and the Kafka Bridge is not supported directly by the Kafka Bridge.
Requests sent from clients to the Kafka Bridge are sent without authentication or encryption.
Requests must use HTTP rather than HTTPS.

You can combine the Kafka Bridge with the following tools to secure it:

* Network policies and firewalls that define which pods can access the Kafka Bridge
* Reverse proxies (for example, OAuth 2.0)
* API gateways
