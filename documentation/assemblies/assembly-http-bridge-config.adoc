= HTTP Bridge configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Configure a deployment of the HTTP Bridge with Kafka-related properties and specify the HTTP connection details needed to be able to interact with Kafka.
Additionally, enable metrics in Prometheus format using either the https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[Prometheus JMX Exporter] or the https://github.com/strimzi/metrics-reporter[Strimzi Metrics Reporter].
You can also use configuration properties to enable and use distributed tracing with the HTTP Bridge.
Distributed tracing allows you to track the progress of transactions between applications in a distributed system.

NOTE: Use the `KafkaBridge` resource to configure properties when you are xref:overview-components-running-http-bridge-cluster-{context}[running the HTTP Bridge on Kubernetes].
