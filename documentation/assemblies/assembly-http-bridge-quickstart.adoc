= HTTP Bridge quickstart

[role="_abstract"]
Use this quickstart to try out the HTTP Bridge in your local development environment.

You will learn how to do the following:

* Produce messages to topics and partitions in your Kafka cluster
* Create a KafHTTPka Bridge consumer
* Perform basic consumer operations, such as subscribing the consumer to topics and retrieving the messages that you produced

In this quickstart, HTTP requests are formatted as curl commands that you can copy and paste to your terminal.

Ensure you have the prerequisites and then follow the tasks in the order provided in this chapter.

In this quickstart, you will produce and consume messages in JSON format.

.Prerequisites for the quickstart

* A Kafka cluster is running on the host machine.
